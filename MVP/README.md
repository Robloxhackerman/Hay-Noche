## File Description

> #### Backend
> **HayNoche-Backend_v2.0 [Sweet Berry]:** This is the latest version of our backend application, here added the "Teatro" entity and it's functionalities

> #### Frontend
> **HayNoche-Fullstack_v1.2 [Cherry Bloom]:** This version can populate it's components with our databases tables by the usage of axios. Axios allows the frontend to contact and read all the data stored in AWS RDS through our backend API (or localhost for development matters). App is currently under plastic surgery and it is looking quite good.

> #### Web Scraping
> **Instagram_Bot:** Script automates the process of downloading posts pictures from Instagram accounts. It is capable of accessing an account, navigating to a specific profile, and downloading all, or a specified number of, posts pictures.
>
> **TickAntel_Bot:** Script is used to web scrape from the webpage TickAntel, with the goal of acquiring all the theater's flyers. Images are then saved to the local directory of our choice.

## License
`Hay Noche` was created for the sole puropose of growing from noobies to professionals. Though, we are looking forward to make this idea come truly alive.
