## File Description


> #### Backend
> - *HayNoche-Backend_v1:* This was our first version with functionalities for "BarRes" & "Promociones" and both being entities and tables are created based on their attributes.
>
>
> - *HayNoche-Backend_v1.1:* Same functionalities as the one before but we handled some attributes with the use of `enum`.
>
>
> - *HayNoche-Backend_v1.2:* Same functionalities, but here we added yet more attributes, relations and handled better the connections between the backend to the local database or AWS RDS plus the access from our frontend to our app.

> #### Frontend
> - **Hay-Noche_Fullstack_v1 :** This was the first version of our frontend application, a skeleton of what we wanted the app to look and function.
>
>
> - **Hay-Noche_Fullstack_v1 test:** Same look of the application but with connections to our backend app in order to populate the frontend with data from our databases.
>
>
> - **HayNoche-Fullstack_v1.1 [Hot Body]:** This was our second version, with a more organized structure, folders are handled in order to mantain a clean look. Very rough draft of what the app actually should look like.

## License
`Hay Noche` was created for the sole puropose of growing from noobies to professionals. Though, we are looking forward to make this idea come truly alive.
